This was a fairly quick bug fix for [wiki:whatsnew/3.4.2 yum-3.4.2] which had a major problem doing non-install transactions in installroots.

== User Interface changes ==

 * Don't show the -c warning due to --installroot.
 * Check if we have read/write access to the current dir. ... if no chdir() to "/" instead of having rpm fail silently.

== Significant bugfixes ==

 * Fix the rpmtransaction chroot problem from 3.4.2.

== API changes ==

 * Don't call *reposetup plugin callbacks more than once, for group install etc. commands.

=== Developer stats. ===
