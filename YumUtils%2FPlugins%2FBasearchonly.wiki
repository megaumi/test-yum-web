= basearchonly =
this plugin makes Yum only install basearch packages on multiarch systems.
If you type 'yum install foo' on a x68_64 system, only 'foo-x.y.x86_46.rpm' is installed.
If you want to install the foo-x.y.i386.rpm, you have to type 'yum install foo.i386'.
The plugin only works with 'yum install'.
