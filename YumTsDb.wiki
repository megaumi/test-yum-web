= this is a draft for a yum history (of transactions) database =
the idea is to keep track of all the info of what happened during a  transaction, what caused it, the commands which invoked it, the state of things when it was invoked, etc.
Giant patch currently available: http://james.fedorapeople.org/yum/patches/history-BIG.patch ... also in my yum git repo. (history branch).

== things current history patch does ==
 * yum nevra+pkgId
 * nevra + checksums in the rpmdb before the ts (kind of, uses rpmdb version).
 * nevra + checksums after the ts
 * package dependencies/relationships within the ts?
   * the proposed actions in the ts
   * the proposed actions in the ts broken down into install/remove te's (we kind of save the TS_STATE)
 * result/errorcode  of the ts run
 * getloginuid() -- something so that different users doing "sudo yum blah" could be differentiated?
 * timestamp of the operation
 * duration
 * undo/repeat API and commands
 * list/info/summary commands

== things current history patch almost does ==
 * all the enabled plugins (nevra+pkgId) -- [We need an API to allow things to add packages to the "transaction performed with packages" list]


== things to maybe track ==
 * yum.conf.*
 * all the repos enabled and timestamps/checksums of their repomd.xml files
 * all the cli options (if any)
 * any/all logging output from the ts (tricksy)
